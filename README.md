# About Me
Hi, I'm Andy. Experienced data analyst focusing primarily in the banking sector.
- I do data stuff like query optimization, data analysis, report automation, and dashboarding. 
- I also dabble with things like building data pipelines and setting up DBs.

## Work
I am currently working at a major financial institution in Europe, specifically in credit risk monitoring.

Before that, I was a research assistant, supporting a project on implementing AI chatbots in university settings.

## Projects
| Name  | Description |
| -------- | ------- |
| Dummy Database  | I create a very simple database that simulates a real-world database for credit monitoring. The idea is that I can reuse this data for my other projects (that the dummy DB has bugs makes it more realistic too ðŸ˜‰). |
| Report Automation | These are some use cases that I have come across in my regular work. PowerShell scripts are used to generate regular reports via direct queries to the dummy DB. |
| Dashboarding | Just some regular tableau dashboarding using the data from the dummy DB. Data preparation also included. |
